              <p>This project's goal was to look into the relationships between various societal factors of different countries like GDP, 
                healthcare coverage, and generosity of citizens and their happiness scores and see if there were statistically significant 
                correlations. We predicted that there would be and more so for GDP and healthcare as they more greatly impact people's 
                livelihoods. Our hypothesis was essentially confirmed, we found statistically significant relationships with all three variables
                but they were much stronger with GDP and coverage versus generosity.</p>
